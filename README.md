# AtmelProcessor
Project for Atmel Microprocessor

This is a class project that I coded the majority of with peer coding with a classmate. The code base is in C and was designed to interact with a Atmel microcontroller. I wrote the code of the final project for an original idea that wasn't a part of class content but used the principles of the class.
